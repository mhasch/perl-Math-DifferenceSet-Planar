=head1 NAME

pds_verify - verify lists of integers as planar difference sets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pds_verify [file]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example program reads planar difference sets, one per line,
as integer numbers separated by whitespace, verifies them, and writes
those of them them back to standard output that are correct.  The program
concludes with a summary of the check results on standard error.  The exit
code is 0 (success) if no lines had to be filtered out, otherwise 1.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The verification method of this tool is based on a full operator table
and thus does not scale very well.  Its answer is conclusive, though.
