=head1 NAME

pds_multipliers - show planar difference set multipliers of a given order

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pds_multipliers p n
  pds_multipliers order

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example program writes multipliers for planar difference sets of a
given order to standard output.  The order can be specified as a prime
number and an exponent, or as a prime power.  The output will be a line
with all multipliers, separated by blanks.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Although it would be conceivable to compute multipliers of very large
sets, this tool is only intended to deal with parameters the rest of the
library could handle, i.e. prime power orders and moduli constrained
to native integer arithmetic.  Arguments beyond that will trigger a
runtime error.
