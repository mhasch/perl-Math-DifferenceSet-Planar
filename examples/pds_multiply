=head1 NAME

pds_multiply - multiply a list of planar difference sets by a factor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pds_multiply factor [file]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example program reads planar difference sets, one per line, as
integer numbers separated by whitespace, multiplies them by the factor
specified on the command line, and writes the result to standard output.

The factor has to be either a multiplier or a rotator for each difference
set, so that the results are also difference sets, or the program will
fail with an error message.
