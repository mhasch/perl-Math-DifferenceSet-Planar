=head1 NAME

Math::DifferenceSet::Planar::Examples - overview of M::DS:P example scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<examples> directory of the Math-DifferenceSet-Planar distribution
currently contains the scripts listed below.  Filters, i.e. scripts that
process sets provided as input, are marked [F].  Scripts with no input
besides command line parameters are marked [P].

=head1 HISTORY

Some examples from earlier releases have been moved from separate scripts
into more general scripts with parameters, particularly where canonization
variants had been the distinctive feature.  Others have been dropped
for being deprecated or lacking relevance.  We list all such changes here.
