This file is a supplement to the default database distributed
with the Perl 5 module Math::DifferenceSet::Planar.

It contains some cyclic planar difference sets with millions of elements
together with space metadata.  Currently, these are the standard reference
sets of orders 2096993, 2097023, and 2097152.

The total numbers of cyclic planar differerence sets of orders
2096993 and 2097023 are 6,445,655,386,288,147,189,605,602, and
6,383,441,485,627,927,292,616,300, respectively.  These sets
have 3 multipliers.  As 2097152 is a 21st power, there are only
302,819,463,165,789,483,798,528 cyclic planar difference sets of order
2097152, while these sets have 63 multipliers.

Standard reference sets are used to calculate unique I<lambda>
and I<theta> values identifying each set.  For example, the
planar difference set generated from the primitive polynomial
I<x^3+x-11 (mod 4,397,381,739,043)> is the first set, multiplied by
I<549,196,322,429 [lambda]>, plus I<1,841,964,303,308 [theta]>.
